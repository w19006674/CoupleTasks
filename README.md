CoupleTasks is a Java Swing desktop application designed to help couples manage and track their shared responsibilities. The app allows users to schedule tasks, complete them, and view leaderboard progress to encourage balanced participation.

---

- Java (Swing for GUI)
- Maven (build tool)
- NetBeans (original IDE)

---

- Add, assign, and track shared household tasks
- View timetables for task scheduling (`TaskTimetable.java`)
- Visual leaderboard to track task completion (`TaskLeaderboard.java`)
- Interactive UI built with Java Swing components

This project includes **manual testing efforts** focused on the app's core flows:

- Functional testing of features like task creation and timetable generation
- Exploratory testing for edge cases and UI behaviors
- Bug documentation and screenshots

See [`testing-docs/CoupleTasks_Testing_Report.pdf`](./testing-docs/CoupleTasks_Testing_Report.pdf) for screenshots and notes from manual testing sessions.

This project was completed in an academic setting and emphasizes both development fundamentals and software testing practice. While the testing is manual, it demonstrates strong understanding of QA workflows and real-world problem analysis.
